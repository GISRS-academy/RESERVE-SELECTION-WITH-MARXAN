# RESERVE-SELECTION-WITH-MARXAN
HABITAT &amp; BIODIVERSITY MODELER IN TERRSET:   RESERVE SELECTION WITH MARXAN

Before this assigment, these lessons should be covered. 

1. Habitat suitability/ Species Distribution Modeling
2. Impact analysis: habitat assessment, habitat change analysis of Bob Cat
3. Biodiversity analysis (Alpha, Beta and Gamma Diversity)
4. Corridor planning, conservation planning


Researve selection using Marxan 
In Marxan, optimization of land is done by heuristic methods. Simulated annealing is the main optimization.

Simulated annealing is the optimizer but the objective function is helps to find what is desirable in a reserve system. The lower the value of the objective function is the better the reserve. Objective function value get by economic cost of the reserve, boundary area and a penalty. 

Data: 
\Data\HBM\Marxan folder

Marxan software (version 1.8.10) download http://www.uq.edu.au/marxan/

Objective of exercise:

To explore the use of Marxan to evaluate Boliviaâ€™s current protected area network, and select a new protected area network to fulfill a specific species area target.

Further detial about the theory, methodology , results and conculsions please check the presentation.
